          providing for the arrangement of elements on a page such\
          that the elements behave predictably when the page layout\
          must accommodate different screen sizes and different display\
          devices. For many applications, the flexible box model provides\
          an improvement over the block model in that it does not use\
          floats, nor do the flex container's margins collapse with\
          the margins of its contents.sintu"
